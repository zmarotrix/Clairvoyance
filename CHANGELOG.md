## 0.9.0 (release candidate), 2026-10-19

The first complete build: every version 1 milestone is in. What's left before 1.0 is a week of
daily play against the in-game checklist (`docs/clairvoyance-checklist.md` in the suite
workspace) and the performance budgets (`/norg perf`).

- **Map, minimap and compass:** objectives in each quest's colour, turn-ins, available quests
  with full availability rules, level-less quests, shift-click hiding and the Hidden chip.
- **Quest tracker:** detailed and compact cards, four sorts, zone groups, pfQuest-style progress
  colours and percentages, finished quests in lime (optionally grouped), distance and direction
  with a set update rate, a drag-to-set length, combat-safe item buttons, party progress.
- **Tooltips** with your quests, progress and party progress (Questie-compatible).
- **Track anything** with the Finder: names and town services, the game's service icons,
  per-entry colours, right-click menu and Clear.
- **Gathering** chips per profession with the next-25-points band; **rares** with named loot and a
  nameplate alert.
- **Automation** (accept, turn in, reward by vendor value, skip gossip), off by default, Shift
  pauses it.
- **Quest log** levels, IDs and Show on map / Point arrow buttons.
- **Settings** per character or global; the welcome runs once per character (Simple, Balanced,
  Everything), and never again on a reload.

Requires NorgannonDB_Core 1.10 (performance profiler, colours for any key, service icons).
